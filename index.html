  <p>When visualizing "intensity vs sector" in a bar chart, you would likely have each bar representing a different
    sector (e.g., "Energy," "Technology," etc.), and the height of the bar would represent the intensity value
    associated with that sector. This helps in comparing the intensity levels across different sectors and identifying
    trends or variations.</p>
  <div id="int_vs_sect"></div>
  <p>X-axis (Likelihood): The x-axis in the bar chart represents the different likelihood values associated with events
    or scenarios. In your dataset, the "likelihood" variable has values like 1, 2, 3, etc., indicating the likelihood
    level of each event.
    Y-axis (Count) : The y-axis represents the count or frequency of occurrences for each likelihood value. For each
    likelihood level (1, 2, 3, etc.), there is a corresponding bar on the chart, and the height of each bar indicates
    how many events or scenarios have that particular likelihood level.</p>

  <p>In the provided code, a bar chart is visualized using D3.js to show the distribution of events across different regions. The data used for this bar chart is based on the region property in each entry of the dataset. The number of events in each region is counted, and a bar chart is created to represent this distribution.</p>
